        I live and breathe software.
        I’m a highly motivated Software Engineer with experience in C, C++, C#, Python, VBA and dealing with information
        systems.
        I’m always curious to learn new stuff and new technologies.
        I have excellent self-learning abilities and I'm able to work independently and in groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am looking for a role where I can grow and continue to learn from other experienced team members.
        I am not afraid to dive deep into unfamiliar code, learn it, and figure out how to solve problems.
    </p>
